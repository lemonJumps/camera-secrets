# Camera secrets

Hi, this is something that I'll be doing some work on.

Essentially in this repository you will find all the different protocols that cameras use to talk to other hardware.

## The reason why this exists

I'm very enthusiastic about shooting night sky.
I'm also interested in photgrammetry and image processing.
And for the longest time I wanted to do my own automated projects, but hardware that was needed for the things I was doing was either Lacking, too expensive for what it is, or straight up didn't exist.

So after being frustrated for so long and not being able to find how to do all this stuff I'm going to reverse engineer EVERYTHING.

## Scope of project

The "reverse engineering" is done from the outside, basically, if it can talk (recieve/send light, electric signals) I'm going to try to talk to it and see what it does.
If there's two pieces of equipment (lens and camera) I'm going to listen to that transaction and translate it.

## What to expect

Essentially, a list of commands and data, along side with a short explanation of the protocol used, methods for reverse engineering it self.
And some interesting thoughts and pointers to important / interesting information.

As well as official and easy to use sources/documents.
Not every time the diy route is the best.
And it there's an easier way, or a tool that does the same thing as you'd do manually I'm going to list them.
